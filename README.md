## ✨ Overview

**RISE** is a next-generation intelligent education system that integrates:

* **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for curriculum-grounded learning
* **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** for multi-agent orchestration
* **Digital Human (DH)** technology for immersive teaching
* **360° virtual classrooms**, real-time student **attention monitoring**, and **adaptive Q&A**
* **Learning analytics**, **virtual home-visit summaries**, and **online assessment**

RISE is designed to run **fully on lightweight web-based infrastructure**, making high-quality intelligent education accessible even on **low-end devices** and in **resource-limited regions**.

## 🔍 Key Features

### 🧭 1. Immersive 360° Learning Environment

* Interactive panoramic scenes (e.g., virtual field trips, cultural learning scenarios)
* Digital human instructor narrating auto-generated lesson content
* Scene switching synchronized with educational narratives

### 👀 2. Real-Time Attention Detection

* Webcam-based head pose & gaze estimation
* Lightweight on-device inference
* Non-intrusive attention reminders to maintain engagement

### 🧠 3. Retrieval-Augmented Educational Q&A

* RAG-based retrieval grounded in textbooks, syllabi, or course documents
* Contextualized explanations aligned with curriculum and student level
* Supports adaptive questioning and misconception correction

### 🤝 4. Multi-Agent Coordination via MCP

* Unified context memory for digital human, RAG agent, and tool calls
* Transparent orchestration of teaching, retrieval, and assessment tasks
* Extensible architecture for new educational agents

### 📊 5. Intelligent Learning Management

* Multi-modal learner analytics
* Virtual home-visit summaries for parents
* LLM-powered exam generation, scoring, and personalized feedback

## 🏗️ System Architecture

RISE consists of two major layers:

```
1. Immersive Delivery Layer
   - Digital Human instructor
   - 360° classroom
   - Attention monitoring

2. Intelligent Processing Layer
   - Educational RAG module
   - LLM-based generation
   - MCP agent coordinator
```

The two layers form a **closed-loop learning workflow**, enabling continuous adaptation and personalized instruction.
